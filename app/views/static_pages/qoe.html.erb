<h1>Predicting Quality of Experience on Mobile Broadband</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Quality of experience (QoE) has become an increasingly important metric for todayâ€™s modern service providers.
  Discovering and optimizing the factors that determine user experience has thus become an essential goal for
  network operators. In this project, I teamed with the Mobility Management and Networking (MOMENT) Lab at UC Santa Barbara
  to focus on exploring the link between key radio measurements and user experience in the context of video streaming sessions.
</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Explore several machine learning algorithms to predict quality of experience from radio and network measurements.
    <ul>
      <li>Random Forest</li>
      <li>ARIMA</li>
      <li>Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Investigate the effect of radio measurements and quality of service (QoS) metrics on quality of experience.
    <ul>
      <li>Radio Measurement: Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP)</li>
      <li>Quality of Service Measurement: Throughput</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
