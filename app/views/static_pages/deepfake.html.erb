<h1>Deepfake Videos</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Just as advances in machine learning gave rise to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake">deepfake videos</a>, so to can modern machine 
  learning models be put to use to realiably detect fake media content. In this project I set out to do just that â€“ first using deep neural networks 
  to generate deepfake videos, then using neural networks to correctly distinguish between fake and unaltered media content. In each scenario, I 
  test the system on a range of different videos in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed network.

<h2>Goals</h2>
  <li>Utilize a generative deep neural network to create deepfake videos.</li>
  <li>Train a neural network architecture to accurately identify deepfake videos.</li>
  <li>Input a variety of altered media content to measure the effectiveness of the proposed systems.</li>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
  <li>The framework proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00196"><i>First Order Motion Model for Image Animation</i></a> generates 
      convincing deepfake videos.</li>
  <li>The network proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07676"><i>Video Face Manipulation Detection Through Ensemble of CNNs</i></a> 
      consistently identifies fake media content.</li>
  <li>Certain data augmentation operations are able to influence the classification results of the deepfake detection system.</li>
