<h1>A SAT Based Scheduler</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Twice a year, the <a href="https://www.ihc.ucsb.edu/">Interdisciplinary Humanities Center at UC Santa Barbara</a> 
  matches volunteer language interpreters with student-teacher conferences throughout the Goleta and Santa Barbara school districts. 
  After a few successful iterations, the demand for interpreters has increased enough to justify the application of a 
  sophisticated scheduling system. In this project, I teamed up with the <i>Interdisciplinary Humanities Center</i> to
  develop such a system, utilizing <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization">Google's CP-SAT Solver</a> to arrange a schedule 
  that fairly, conveniently and optimally pairs interpreters with student-teacher conferences.

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Collect and organize all interpreter availability and teacher meeting requests.</li>
  <li>When pairing interpreters with student-teacher conferences, the scheduling approach should be:</li>
      <ul>
      <li><i>Objective-driven</i>: A maximal number of student-teacher conferences include an interpreter.</li>
      <li><i>Constraint-driven</i>: Schedules are fair, convenient and practical for all interpreters and teachers.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Create and distribute personalized schedules for both interpreters and teachers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Googleâ€™s open source software suite <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization">OR-Tools</a> provides 
    many useful models for constraint programming problems.</li>
  <li>The solution space of all combinations matching interpreters to student-teacher conferences is huge.</li>
  <li>As expected, the SAT solver does not scale efficiently and quickly grows unmanageable as input increases.</li>
  <li>While unable to scale efficiently, Google's CP-SAT Solver nonetheless provides an optimal schedule.</li>
</ul>
